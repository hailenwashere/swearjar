# swearjar
memes to count how many times you and your friends have said a collection of colorful words in a discord server using a bot

courtesy of me and @cow-moo, who worked on this with me on discord LOL

to use:
- make sure your bot is in the server
- replace the DISCORD_TOKEN with your own bot's
- type in swear words you want to count on each line in swear.txt
- when someone texts any of the swear words in the swear.txt file, swear jar will respond with a custom message set in swearjar.py
- the number of swears said by users is local, but using $save can upload to txt files "realswearjar.txt" and "userswear"
